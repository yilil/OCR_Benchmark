sons, ROBERT W. FAIRSERVICE, II, and DAVID E. FAIRSERVICE, currently of Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania, in as nearly equal shares as possible, and I charge them with the responsibility of amicably deciding the division of such property between themselves.
If either of my said sons shall predecease me, or in the event that either of my sons and I should die simultaneously, then and in such event, the share of my residuary Estate intended for such one's benefit shall vest in and be distributed to his issue who survive me, per stirpes. If such son of mine shall have died leaving no issue surviving me, then the  property of my remaining son who is living at the time of my death.
ARTICLE V I hereby nominate, constitute and appoint my wife, BETTY LOUISE FAIRSERVICE, to act as Personal Representative of this, my Last Will and Testament, with full power to do any and all things necessary for the complete administration of my estate, including the power to sell real or personal property belonging to the estate at public or private sale, and I direct that no bond shall be required of her acting in such capacity. In the event of the failure to qualify, disqualification, death or resignation of my wife, BETTY LOUISE FAIRSERVICE, as Personal Representative, then I hereby nominate, constitute and appoint my two sons, ROBERT W. FAIRSERVICE, II, and DAVID E. FAIRSERVICE, to act in her stead, without bond, and with the same powers and duties herein conferred upon my said wife, BETTY LOUISE FAIRSERVICE. In the event that either of my two sons is unable or unwilling to serve as a Co-Personal Representative, then my remaining son may serve in such capacity alone, without bond and without any diminution in his powers as Personal Representative.
IN WITNESS hereof, I have hereunto set my hand and seal at Winter Haven, Polk County, Florida, this 15th day of September, 1997.
