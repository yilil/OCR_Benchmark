1, Diane Maria Klodnicki Davidson Eichner, being of sound mind and being hereby revoke any will and testament I have signed... My wish is to have my estate equally divided to my children, Amanda Grace and Benjamin Henry Eichner.
In our family trust from Doran Tisser, I want to keep the clause of my estate separate from the event Elliot Keith Eichner becomes remarried.  In the event of an illness, please do not resuscitate. Donations to my pets will be for their well being out of my estate.
I bequeath to my daughter, Amanda Grace Eichner, all of my jewelry including my beloved wedding rings from Elliot Keith Eichner. When she turns 21 years of age, she may keep, distribute, or sell my property.
