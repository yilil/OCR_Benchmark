ITEM THREE: I authorize my Executors to have full power at their discretion to do any and all things necessary for the complete administration of my estate, including the right to compromise or settle and adjust any and all claims, charges, debts and demands whatsoever against or in favor of my estate as fully as I could do if living,
ITEM FOUR: I have not made any provision in this my Last Will and Testament for my beloved wife, LYDIA EVANETSKI, because I have made certain provisions for her during my lifetime.
