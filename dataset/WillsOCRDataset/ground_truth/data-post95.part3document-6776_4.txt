LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF ALICE ERHARD
I, ALICE ERHARD, 1555 North Washington Avenue, City of Scranton, State of Pennsylvania, hereby declare this to be my Last Will and Testament and revoke all Wills I have previously made.
FIRST: I direct that the expense of my last illness, funeral and all just debts be paid as soon as practical after my death.
SECOND: give and devise my house and real estate to 1555 North Washington Avenue, Scranton, to my son Christopher Erhard, but not my furniture and furnishings, except for the porch furniture and one Persian rug in the formal living room. It is my fervent wish and desire, but not a mandatory part of this devise and bequest, that this home and real estate remain in the Erhard family. If my son Christopher should predecease me, this bequest shall go to my surviving children equally.
THIRD: I give, devise and bequeath the remainder of my household furniture and furnishings and the rest and residue of my estate and property, whether real, personal or mixed, of every kind and nature and wherever situated, to my son, John F. III, my daughter, Marla and my son, Michael, share and share alike. If any of these children should predecease me without issue, their share shall be divided between the survivors of them.
