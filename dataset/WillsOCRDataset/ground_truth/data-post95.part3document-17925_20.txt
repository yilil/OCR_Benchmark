is in excess of the amount which may be paid to the natural guardian; and I authorize said guardians to retain such property in kind or to sell the same, giving good title to any real estate, to invest and reinvest without being limited to "legal" investments and to use both income and principal for the minor's health, maintenance, support and education, including college expenses.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and seal this 21 day of October, 2002.
